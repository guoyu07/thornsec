# Want to contribute?

1. What command should a sysadmin run to check if there is an issue?
2. What should the output of that command be if the test is passed or failed?
3. Bonus points: what command should a sysadmin run to resolve the issue?

If you can answer the first 2 questions then get in touch or write the appropriate test for inclusion into the codebase. If you can answer question 3 thats even better!
