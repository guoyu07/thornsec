Not orgsec. Not infosec. Not opsec. Hopefully just a small thorn in the side of your adversaries. - @ThornSec

# Problem: 
1.  "I hunt sysadmins" - https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/;
2.  Organisations switching to in-house systems requires configuration and maintenance to be secure;
3.  Funding bodies giving money to organisation but no tech resources for their internal systems;
4.  Senior management no knowing about the state of their tech resources;
5.  Information of how to prioritise resources;
6.  Lack of visibility into systems and networks;
7.  Lack of effective preventative measures;
8.  Lack of compartmentalisation;
9.  Lack of secure and off site backups;
10. Lack of resiliency.

# Solution: 
"Sysadmins of the world unite!" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzhtGvSflEk

# Goals
1. Platform to make systems more secure than default.
2. Platform to translate articulation and discussion of complex security debates into concrete 
      1) audit test for the problem, and possibly; 
      2) way to automatically remedy it.
3. Platform for sysadmins to contribute unit tests for servers and networks.
4. Platform requiring minimal pre-requisites: debian on server + java on client.
5. Platform to conduct external audit e.g pentest
